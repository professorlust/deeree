Phonology regards the phonemes incorporated into the language, consonants or vowels, and their use in syllables and words.

Romanization is done with the IPA symbols, that is, the ones in table \ref{tab:phon-ipa-cons}, except for \ipaS, \ipaZ~and \ipaR, which are written respectively as \emph{sh}, \emph{zh} and \emph{r}. Pronunciation
of these three letters is:

\begin{description}
\item[sh] as in English ‘\emph{sh}eep’
\item[zh] as in English ‘vi\emph{si}on’
\item[r]  as in French  ‘F\emph{r}ance’
\end{description}

\jissec{Consonant pairs}
The combinations of consonants allowed are the following: \textbf{tr, dr, pl, bl, kl, gl, kr, gr}. Other will occur due to phonotactics, but no other beginning in a plosive.

\jisec{Vowels}
The nine vowels are as described (IPA and orthography) in table \ref{tab:phon-ipa-vowels}.

\begin{table}[h]\label{tab:phon-ipa-vowels}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
	& Front & Back \\\hline
Closed	& /i/, /y/ <ù> & /u/ \\\hline
Mid	& /e\textasciitilde\ipaE/, /\ipaET(j)/ <ẽi>, /ø{\textasciitilde}œ/ <ë> & /o\textasciitilde\ipaO/ \\\hline
Open	& /a/ & /\ipaAT/ <ã> \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Vowels in Deẽreẽ}
\end{table}

\jissec{On /{\ipaET}j/ or /\ipaET/}
One of the doubtful phonemes in Deẽreẽ’s phonology is the grapheme <ẽi>’s pronunciation. It can be pronounced with palatalization or not, that is, /{\ipaET}j/ or /\ipaET/. How to pronounce it is normally determined by its position in the word.

As the last phoneme of a word <ẽi> will be palatalized: /{\ipaET}j/. But when <ẽi> is initial or inside a word, it will be pronounced as either palatalized or not. When followed by j, l, s, n, p, t, or sh, that is a consonant from bilabial to palatal but not further back (k, g, r), it is palatalized, otherwise it is not.

\jisec{Phonotactics}
The syllable structure is \textbf{(C|B)V(L)(F)} where:
\begin{description}
\item[C] is any consonant
\item[B] is a group of two consonants among \emph{tr, dr, pl, bl, kl, gl, kr, gr}
\item[V] is any vowel
\item[L] is a consonant among \emph{j, l, r, s}
\item[F] word-final only, a consonant among \emph{n, p, t, k, f, s, sh, l}
\end{description}

\jissec{Vowel pairs}
Quite often, two vowels will appear in a word consecutively. In this case, there are three cases: long vowel, diaeresis, or semi-vowel.

\jisssec{Long vowel sounds}
In a word like \newgle{aal}{wind}\gls{aal}, There is a long vowel sound due to vowel reduplication. There, it is pronounced as [a.al], instead of [a:l]. That is, the real pronounciation of this word is as close to diaeresis as possible, as opposed to a ‘real’ long vowel.

\jisssec{Diaeresis}
\newgle{tëfuete}{to wipe}
\newgle{fùã}{powder}
Two consecutive vowels will give a diaeresis, that is, the two vowels being pronounced separately without any semi-vowel, in words like \gls{fùã}, powder, or before a verb ending, for example in \gls{tëfuete}, to wipe.

\jisssec{Semi-vowel}
\newgle{marùëlf}{nature}
A semi-vowel, that is, a sound like /j/, /w/, or /ɥ/ (the \emph{u} in the French huit), is used in various words, for example the Deẽreẽ word for nature, \gls{marùëlf}.
