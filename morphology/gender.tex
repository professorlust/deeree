\jisec{Gender}
Deẽreẽ has three genders: Human, marked \emph{H}, Magic, marked \emph{M}, and Common, marked
\emph{C}. Every word has a gender, whatever its grammatical nature (part of speech) might be: nouns
have gender, but verbs have gender too, as well as adjectives. Words that are not nouns do not just
agree in gender (if they do), but has their own intrinsic categories.

To determine the gender of a word, you have to look at its last vowel (whether or not it ends in a
vowel). The rules are in table \ref{tab:morph-genders}.

\begin{table}[h]\label{tab:morph-genders}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Human}  & e & ẽi & u\\\hline
\textbf{Magic}  & a & ã  & o\\\hline
\textbf{Common} & ù & ë  & i\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Vowels in the Deẽreẽ genders (H:e/ẽi/u, M:a/ã/o, C:ù/ë/i)}
\end{table}

For example:
\begin{description}
\newgle{zhalbarki}{beer}\newgle{drete}{to go}\newgle{magra}{soul}
\item[\gls{zhalbarki}] beer, ending in \emph{i}, is of \emph{Common} gender
\item[\gls{drete}] to go, ending in \emph{e}, is of \emph{Human} gender
\item[\gls{magra}] soul, ending in \emph{a}, is of \emph{Magic} gender
\end{description}
