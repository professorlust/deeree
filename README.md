# Deẽreẽ

The _Deẽreẽ_, is a constructed language of my invention.
Its purpose is to represent the speech of the _Kingdom of Reosal_, a fantasy
world setting originally designed for a tabletop roleplaying game.

Five interesting features of this language are as follows:

* The three noun classes _Human_, _Magic_ and _Common_;
* The absence of a verb _to be_;
* The person suffixes;
* OVS sentence order;
* The sound inventory close to French.

This work is put close to the public domain thanks to the CC0 license accessible
